# My Mac Setup ðŸ’»

This repo contains info on all the apps / tools / settings I use on my Mac.

## Homebrew / Terminal / Shell

### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) allows us to install tools and apps from the command line.

To install it, open up the built in `Terminal` app and run this command:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### Terminal

The first app I install is to replace the built in `Terminal`.

I prefer [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

```
brew install iterm2
```

These are my preferred settings:
[iTerm Theme](/iterm-theme.json)

Font: Hack Nerd Font Mono

### Shell

[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) gives you a bunch of customizations out of the box.

## OS Productivity/Other apps
